## AI Task: Complete README Transformation

Hello Cursor AI! Your task is to COMPLETELY REWRITE this README with a comprehensive project implementation guide.

### Critical Requirements:

1. **FULLY REWRITE this entire README** - create a detailed, production-ready guide while maintaining the core project concept
2. **Create a DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP PLAN (max 8 steps)** that covers:
   - Environment setup with all required technologies
   - Project structure creation
   - Implementation of core features
   - Testing and deployment approaches
3. **Tailor content to the user's profile:**
   - User's Experience Level: `Intermediate`
   - User's Available Time: `Months+`
4. **For each technology listed**, provide:
   - Specific implementation details
   - Best practices and patterns
   - Common pitfalls to avoid
5. **Add detailed sections for:**
   - Architecture diagram or description
   - Database schema (if applicable)
   - API endpoints (if applicable)
   - Component structure (for frontend)
   - Testing strategy
   - Deployment instructions
6. **Provide code examples** for critical project parts
7. **REMOVE THESE INSTRUCTIONS COMPLETELY** after your rewrite

Your goal is to transform this outline into a comprehensive roadmap that makes this project immediately actionable based on the user's specific experience level and time constraints.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL FIRST STEP ‚ö†Ô∏è

**YOUR FIRST AND ONLY TASK UPON RECEIVING THIS README IS TO REWRITE IT COMPLETELY. DO NOT START IMPLEMENTING THE PROJECT OR WRITING ANY CODE YET.**

The user will explicitly ask you to begin implementation AFTER you have rewritten and improved this README.

# Customer Feedback Analytics Platform

## Project Overview
A comprehensive platform to collect, analyze, and visualize customer feedback to enhance customer experience and drive business growth.


> **üí° Quick Start:** After cloning this repository and opening it in Cursor, simply tell the AI: "Read the README and guide me through implementing this project step by step." Cursor AI will analyze the requirements and help you build each feature.


## User Profile
- **Experience Level:** Intermediate
- **Available Time to Complete:** Months+

## Technologies
- **React**: Used for building the frontend web application, providing an interactive and responsive user interface for customers to submit feedback.
- **Node.js**: Utilized for building the backend API, handling feedback submissions, and integrating with data analytics tools.
- **MongoDB**: Employed as the NoSQL database to store and manage large volumes of customer feedback data.
- **D3.js**: Used for creating interactive and informative data visualizations to help businesses understand customer feedback trends and patterns.
- **Google Cloud Natural Language**: Integrated to analyze customer feedback using natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and entity recognition.
- **AWS S3**: Used for storing and serving static assets, such as images and videos, to enhance the customer feedback submission experience.


## Development Steps
### 1. Set up Project Infrastructure
Create a new React project using a template, set up a Node.js backend API, and configure MongoDB for data storage.

### 2. Design Feedback Submission Form
Design and implement a user-friendly feedback submission form using React, incorporating features such as rating systems and comment fields.

### 3. Develop API for Feedback Submission
Create a RESTful API using Node.js to handle feedback submissions, validate user input, and store data in MongoDB.

### 4. Implement Data Analytics and Visualization
Integrate D3.js to create interactive data visualizations, and utilize Google Cloud Natural Language to analyze customer feedback sentiment and trends.

### 5. Deploy and Test the Platform
Deploy the platform on AWS, configure AWS S3 for static asset storage, and conduct thorough testing to ensure platform stability and performance.


## Main Features
Features will be added soon


## Sample Code
```javascript
// Example code snippet for feedback submission API
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.post('/submit-feedback', (req, res) => {
  // Handle feedback submission logic
});
```


## Getting Started
Instructions will be added soon

## AI Coding Prompts

Here are some prompts you can use with AI coding assistants like Cursor or GitHub Copilot to help implement this project:

### Prompt 1
```
Implement the feedback submission API using Express.js, starting with a basic route handler that accepts a JSON payload with customer feedback data. Include error handling to ensure proper responses for successful and failed submissions.
```

### Prompt 2
```
Integrate the Google Cloud Natural Language API to analyze the customer feedback data, extracting sentiment, entities, and keywords. Store the analyzed data in a MongoDB collection for future use in data visualizations and business insights.
```

### Prompt 3
```
Enhance the feedback submission experience by adding a feature to upload images and videos using AWS S3, and display them in the React frontend application using D3.js for interactive visualizations. Implement a progress bar to show the status of the submission process.
```


Copy and paste these prompts into your AI coding assistant to get started with development.
